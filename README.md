# Design-and-Development-of-an-Autonomous-Line-Follower-Robot-Using-PID-Control
This project aims to design and develop an autonomous line follower robot capable of tracking paths accurately and stably using an Arduino Nano based control system and a PD (Proportional Derivative) control algorithm. The development process includes electronic and mechanical system design, PCB layout creation, hardware assembly, microcontroller programming, sensor calibration, and controller parameter tuning to achieve optimal performance. The system utilizes eight photodiode sensors read through a multiplexer for pin efficiency, an L293DN motor driver, and an OLED display for real time monitoring. 

The project output is a high performance line follower robot that demonstrates fast, stable, and precise motion control. This project can be applied in learning platforms for control systems, mobile robotics, embedded systems, and as a foundation for autonomous robot development in industrial automation and robotics competitions.
